## Morning Session

Decided to try to do the development with GCC in a Dockers container.

Had Dockers Desktop on current computer but it broke when updating. Reinstalled version 4.9.1.

Installed a GCC docker container and could compile and run the GuessNumber example.

Developing on the command line in the Docker container felt a bit to crude so decided that this will not be my main choice.

Will instead go for VS Code under Windows using CMake and GCC from MSYS2.

## Lunch Session

Looked over my MSYS2 installation. Started MSYS2 MSYS from the Windows Start menu on the development computer. Then updated MSYS2 using the command `pacman -Syu`.

Started MSYS MinGW 64-bit and checked the GCC version, this was reported to be 10.3.0.
