Decided to try to do the development with GCC in a Dockers container.

Had Dockers Desktop on current computer but it broke when updating. Reinstalled version 4.9.1.

Installed a GCC docker container and could compile and run the GuessNumber example.

Developing on the command line in the Docker container felt a bit to crude so decided that this will not be my main choice.

Will instead go for VS Code under Windows using CMake and GCC from MSYS2.
